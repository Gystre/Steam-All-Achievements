# Steam-All-Achievements
get all achievements for steam, works like 70% of the time lmao
ur gonna have to run it a couple times for it to register it all

code is super messy and super inefficient in terms of ram (each process takes 8-10mb * amt of games u own) but hey at least it's can take adavantage of multiple cores HAHAHAHAH

to run, just build KW Steam Achievements and click the button. Don't use the HeadlessGame.exe cuz that's only to be used by aforementioned program.

90% of code from SAM (https://github.com/gibbed/SteamAchievementManager) *thanks man :3
